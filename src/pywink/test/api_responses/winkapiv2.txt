# Wink API
The Wink API connects Wink devices to users, apps, each other, and the wider web.

NOTE: This is the documentation for the v2 version of the Wink API. It has breaking changes on the [original API](http://docs.wink.apiary.io/) published in 2013. If you are a user of the original API but would like access to this version, please contact Wink Support to ask for a new set of credentials.


# Group A RESTful Service
The Wink API is a [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) service.

## Authentication
Nearly every request to the Wink API requires an OAuth bearer token.

Exceptions to this rule will be documented.

## Content types
Nearly every request to the Wink API should be expressed as JSON.

Nearly every response from the Wink API will be expressed as JSON.

Exceptions to this rule will be documented.

## HTTP verbs
The Wink API uses HTTP verbs in pretty standard ways:

- GET for retrieving information without side-effects
- PUT for updating existing resources, with partial-update semantics supported
- POST for creating new resources or blind upserts of existing resources
- DELETE for destructive operations on existing resurces

## Identifiers
All objects in the Wink API can be identified by `object_type` and `object_id`. The `object_id` is a string and not globally unique, currently. That is there can be an `'object_type':'light_bulb'` and `'object_id':'abc'` and an `'object_type':'thermostat'` and `'object_id':'abc'`

It is possible for the API to re-assign identifiers to resources to rebalance keys; in this case, your resource will still exist but it (and all references to it) will be updated to the new identifier.  Your application should be able to handle this case.

## Creatable vs. permanent
The term "creatable" will describe a resource which may be created and/or destroyed by the user.

The term "permanent" will describe a resource which may not be directly created or deleted by a user.

Note that permanent **does not imply** that the resource will always exist, just that the user may not create or destroy it.  Under no circumstances should you assume that a resource will always exist.

## Mutable vs. immutable
The term "mutable" will describe a resource or attribute which the user may modify at will, assuming the user has the necessary permissions to do so.

The term "immutable" will describe a resouce or attribute which may not be modified directly by the user.

Note that immutable **does not imply** that the resource or attribute will never change, just that the user may not directly change it.  Under no circumstances should you assume that a resource or attribute will always remain the same.

## Error states
The common [HTTP Response Status Codes](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/status-codes.md) are used.

                "token_type": "bearer"
            }
        }



# Group Subscriptions

Real-time updates through the Wink API are managed by [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/)

**Subscriptions are organized around "topics"**

Subscriptions to topics fall into two categories: Lists and Objects.

List subscriptions send updates when an object is added or removed from the list. For example, a subscription to `/users/me/wink_devices` would trigger an update when a new device is added to a user account.

Object subscriptions send updates when an object is updated in any way. For example, a subscription to `/light_bulbs/abc` would trigger an update when a light bulb goes from powered off to powered on.
Several changes may be aggregated into a single broadcast, when the changes have happened in rapid succession.

To subscribe to a topic, find the subscription object inside the response from a GET request to either a list or an object.

        "subscription": {
            "pubnub": {
                "subscribe_key": "worghwihr0aijyp5ejhapethnpaethn",
                "channel": "w0y8hq03hy5naeorihnse05iyjse5yijsm"
            }
        }

# Group Device

**Common patterns and fields of Wink API Devices**

Specific fields, particularly in desired_state and last_reading will be outlined in the object-specific sections

Each Wink Device can have the following attributes, but not all attributes will be populated

Prepare to receive null for any one of these. For specific implementations, refer to the device documentation of the given device type.

|API field|Attributes|Description|
|----|----|----|
|object_type|(string, assigned)|type of object (NOTE: legacy apps expect a specific type id such as "light_bulb_id")|
|object_id|(string, assigned)|id of object (NOTE: legacy apps expect a specific type id such as "light_bulb_id")|
|name|(String, writable)|Name of the device, default given by server upon provisioning but can be updated by user|
|locale |(String, format LL_CC -- "en_us", "fr_fr")|Can be updated by user, but not exposed in the app, usually based of user's locale|
|units|(object, specific to device)|See [Units](/Wink_Devices/General/API/Units)|
|created_at|(long, timestamp, immutable)|Time device was added to account|
|subscription|(pubnub subscription object)|See [Subscription](/General/API/Subscriptions)|
|manufacturer_device_model|(String, assigned)|snaked case, unique device model|
|manufatcurer_device_id | (String, assigned | udid of third party device in third party system|
|hub_id|(String, assigned)|id of hub associated with device, only for devices with hub|
|local_id|(String, assigned)| id of device on hub, only for devices with hub|
|radio_type | (String, assigned)|currently only for devices with hub, available values "zigbee", "zwave", "lutron", "wink_project_one"|
|device_manufacturer|(String, assigned)|Human readable display string of manufacturer|
|lat_lng |(tuple of floats, writable)|location of device|
|location|(String, writable)|pretty printable location of device|
|desired_state|(object, values of requested state)| Depends on object type|
|last_reading|(object, values of last reading from device)| Depends on object type|
|capabilities|(object, specific capabilities of this object)| for instance for sensor the last_reading values available|
        
## Capabilities

The API sets capabilities for devices to indicate whether a field is present, whether it is mutable and what are the allowed values.

The power of capabilities allow for devices with different attributes to have the same object type. An example is using capabilties to distinguish a light bulb that has only has dimming capabilites from a light bulb that has dimming and color changing capabilities. 

Capabilities currently contains one object `fields`, an array object of field capabilities.

Note: note all devices have capabilities. Some legacy devices added in the first six months of the Wink API have yet to be converted.

### Field attributes
|API field|Attributes|Description|
|----|----|----|

|range|(tuple)|tuple of upper and lower bounds for field. For integer and float fields|


            {
                "fields": [{
                        "field": "connection",
                        "type": "boolean",
                        "mutability": "read-only"

                        "mutability": "read-write"
                    }, {
                        "field": "color_temperature",
                        "type": "integer",
                        "range": [2000, 6500],
                        "mutability": "read-write"
                }]
            }
## Desired State and Last Reading [/{device_type}/{device_id}/desired_state]

The desired_state/last_reading paradigm is available in almost all wink devices. Fields in desired_state are what the client requests the state of the device to be, whereas fields in last_reading are what the API believes to be the current state of things. To keep requested changes distinct and distinguishable from real changes, each desired_state field has the following counterparts in last_reading

* `desired_foo`
* `desired_foo_updated_at`
* `foo`
* `foo_updated_at`
* `foo_changed_at` - this differs from update indicating when a reading was altered, in contrast to updated indicating the last time a reading was reported by a device

When the device acknowledges that the state has been applied, the server will clear the field from desired_state. Then last_reading.x, last_reading.x_updated_at and last_reading.x_changed_at will update appropriately.

If a device fails to change to the desired_state, likely due to a failure of some kind including the device being offline, the server will give up after 2 minutes and clear desired_state. Only last_reading.x_updated_at would update in that case as there was no change to the actual reading.

The consequences of this change are two-fold

- The clients can definitively know if a requested change has not yet been applied or failed to be applied. This means that UIs such as garage door and lock that depend on an applied state do not have to have an arbitrary time out. Or UIs such as the lights UI can display when a request is in progress
- When changes are requested, only those attributes that are actually changed will be applied rather than re-applying an entire desired_state when changing one attribute.

Throughout the rest of the documentation, writable states will only be documented under desired_state and read only states will be documented under last_reading

# Group Member

Members are used throughout the API for group hetereogenous devices in scenes, groups and robots. There are no specific endpoints for members and their creation and updating will happen within their respective parents

## Member model

Members have the following attributes

|API field|Attributes|Description|
|----|----|----|
|object_id|(string, assignable)|API id|
|object_type|(string, assignable)|value will be singular types of wink devices and objects. i.e. air_conditioner, propane_tank, outlet, light_bulb, etc.|
|desired_state|(object)|current or requested desired_state of object|

# Group Group

**Resources for creating and controlling groups of devices**
 
The group resource is a representation of a group of wink devices which may be controlled simultaneously. In addition, the group will have an aggregated reading to get the aggregate state of the grouped devices.

The Wink API defines certain special groups which you cannot fully control.  These include, but are not limited to:

 - System categories such as `.all` and `.sensors`, which will include respectively every product and every product which is contains environment sensors of any kind.  You cannot create, delete, or rename system categories.  You cannot add or remove objects from system categories.  System categories have an `automation_mode` flag of `system_category`.
 - User categories such as `@door_sensors` and `@power`.  Some devices will appear in these categories by default, based on our best guess of how these devices will be used by most consumers.  You cannot create, delete, or rename user categories.  You can, however, add and remove objects, if our default classifications are not appropriate.  User categories have an an `automation_mode` flag of `user_category`.


The group resource has the following attributes:

|API field|Attributes|Description|
|---|---|---|
|name|(string, mutable)|User defined name. *NOTE* system_category and user_category names are immutable. In addition, an error will be thrown if a user tries to name their group the same name as a category group|
|members|(0 to many objects, assignable)|[Member object](/General/API/Member)|
|automation_mode|(string, assigned, immutable)|system_category or user_category, also indicated by a prefix of `.` or `@`|
|reading_aggregation|(object)|aggregated last_reading of group devices|
|desired_state|(object)|desired state PUT to change all members simultaneously|


Optional member attributes:
|blacklisted_readings|(array of strings, assignable)|Once set, this member will not contribute to the group aggregation of blacklisted readings|

#### Reading Aggregation Model

Reading aggregation differ from last_reading in that the fields identify a count of state or an average/max/min

**Boolean Aggregation**

A boolean aggregation has the following fields

|API field|Attributes|Description|
|----|----|----|
|updated_at|(timestamp|Last time aggregation was updated|
|or|(boolean)|Whether the aggregation is driven by OR logic|
|and|(boolean)|Whether the aggregation is driven by AND logic|
|true_count|(integer)|How many members in the group are registering the given boolean field as true|
|false_count|(integer)|How many members in the group are registering the given boolean field as false|

**Numeric Aggregation**

A numeric aggregation has the following fields

|API field|Attributes|Description|
|----|----|----|
|updated_at|(timestamp|Last time aggregation was updated|
|min|(float)|Lowest reading of members|
|max|(float)|Highest reading of members|
|average|(float)|Average reading of all members, currently unweighted|

When you post up a desired state object, the API will then change all the devices in the group to that desired state. Allowed values for desired_state are dependent on the devices in the group and you should refer to individual device documentation.

If you have multiple types of devices in a group and a field in the desired_state object only applies to some of them, such as `color` for `light_bulb` types, the API will update the appropriate devices and ignore that state for devices that do not have a color state, such as air_conditioners

# Group Scene

A scene is a collection of desired states for any supported Wink device (such as an air conditioner or garage door) or any Wink object (such as the outlet on a powerstrip). The scene members can be heterogenous and the member objects are composed as defined above in member.
A scene member must have a valid desired state for the object type in order to be valid.

# Group Robot

A Robot is the API object that allows for automations based on external triggers such as time or another device's state

## Robot Model

|API field|Attributes|Description|
|----|----|----|
|name|(string, writable)|User defined name|
|creating_actor_type|(string, assigned)|type of entity that created the robot, can be user or device in case of smart features|
|creating_actor_id|(string, assigned)|id of entity that created the robot|
|automation_mode|(string, writable)|mode of robot if generated for smart features, current possible values -- null (not smart), "smart_schedule", "smart_away_arriving", "smart_away_departing"; client writable values "notification" (fridge note), "tapt" (created implicitly through relay or tapt interface)|
|causes|(array, 1 to many Conditions)| Cause(s) that will trigger the robot|
|restrictions|(0 to many Conditions)| Restriction(s) that would prevent the robot from triggering on the given causes. **NOTE** while documented, currently this is not exposed on the clients|
|effects|(array, 1 to many|Effect of robot when triggered|

### Desired State Fields
|API field|Attributes|Description|
|----|----|----|
|enabled|(boolean, writable)|Whether or not the robot is currently enabled|
|fired_limit|(integer, writable)|How many times the robot can fire. A value of null or 0 means the robot can fire as many times as possible. Currently used by Refrigerator note robots|

### Last Reading Fields
|API field|Attributes|Description|
|----|----|----|
|fired|(boolean)|Whether the robot has fired|

## Condition Model

The causes array is an array of Conditions that can trigger a robot. The restrictions array is an array of Conditions that can prevent a robot from being fired, even if it is triggered by a cause.

A condition has the following format:

|API field|Attributs|Description|
|----|----|----|
|condition_id|(string, assigned, immutable)|id of condition|
|observed_field|(string, writable)|field in last reading|
|observed_object_id|(string, writable)|id of object being observed|
|observed_object_type|(string, writable)|type of object being observed, ex. "garage_door"|
|operator|(string, writable)|comparison operator|
|value|(string, writable)|desired value of observed_field|
|recurrence|(text, writeable)|iCal string|
|restriction_join|(string, writable)|"and" or "or"|
|robot_id|(integer, writable)|id of robot|
|restricted_object_id|(integer, writable)|if this condition is restricting something, the id of what is being restricted|
|restricted_object_type|(string, writable)|if this condition is restricting something, the type of what is being restricted, currently "robot" or "condition"|
|restrictions|(array of 0 to many)|embedded condition objects to restrict parent condition|

For causes and restrictions, their truthiness is evaluated in the following order:

- `recurrence && observed_field && restrictions.`

### Condition recurrence

Recurrence should be a string in iCal format and is to be used for a condition dependent on a time. If the recurrence is nil, it's evaluation is true. Thus, to omit a time restriction, set the recurrence string to null. If the recurrence is meant to restrict time for firing, it should have a start and end. See below for examples.

+ It is 5 pm on a Tuesday

        {
            "recurrence": "DTSTART;TZID=PDT:20140313T170000nRRULE:FREQ=DAILY"
        }

+ It is between 8pm and 10pm on Tuesdays

        {
            "recurrence": "DTSTART;TZID=PDT:20140313T200000nDTEND;TZID=PDT:20140313T220000nRRULE:FREQ=DAILY"
        }

+ Every day at sunrise in my current location

        {
            "recurrence": "DTSTART;TZID=PDT:20140313T080000nX-WINK-STSTART:sunrise;37.47;-122.25nDTEND;TZID=PDT:20140314T080000nRRULE:FREQ=DAILY"
        }

+ Every day at sunset in my current location

        {
            "recurrence": "DTSTART;TZID=PDT:20140313T200000nX-WINK-STSTART:sunset;37.47;-122.25nDTEND;TZID=PDT:20140314T200000nRRULE:FREQ=DAILY"
        }

+ Every day between sunrise and sunset in my current location

        {
            "recurrence": "DTSTART;TZID=PDT:20140313T200000nX-WINK-STSTART:sunrise;37.47;-122.25nDTEND;TZID=PDT:20140314T210000nRX-WINK-STEND:sunset;37.47;-122.25nRULE:FREQ=DAILY"
        }

### Condition observed fields

The following fields are all required to properly evaluate observed_field

- observed_field
- operator
- value

observed_field can be any field in a device's last_reading object

operator can be only of the following, as strings

- ==
- !=
- >
- <
- >=
- <=

value is the value that will be used in comparison with the operator.

**NOTE:** although you can compare multiple types of values, such as boolean, string, int, or float, this value should be put and read as a string. See examples below.

In order to evaluate to true, the observed field's value must be evaluated to true with the given operator

+ Example of a condition: a garage door is opened by at least 50%

        {
            "observed_object_id":"xyzasdfadsfhkj",
            "observed_object_type":"garage_door",
            "observed_field": "position",
            "operator": ">=",
            "value": "0.5"
        }

+ Example of a condition: geo fence is entered

        {
            "observed_object_id":"defasdfkjha",
            "observed_object_type":"geofence",
            "observed_field": "within",
            "operator": "==",
            "value": "true"
        }

+ Example of a condition: geo fence is exited

        {
            "observed_object_id":"defasdfkjha",
            "observed_object_type":"geofence",
            "observed_field": "within",
            "operator": "==",
            "value": "false"
        }


#### Restriction Evaluation

Each condition can have embedded restrictions to create complex logic.

By default, each restriction in the array is joined by "and" so that all the restrictions in the array must evaluate to true in order for restrictions to evaluate to true.

You can join restrictions by "or" by add  a

- restriction_join [allowed values "and" "or"]

**NOTE ABOUT COMPLEXITY**

Because each restriction is of the same class as the top level Condition, each embedded restriction goes through the same evaluation process for truthiness and can similarly have embedded restrictions of its own.

The restrictions defined in the top level "restrictions" array of the robot object are joined by "and". From there, nested restrictions are joined based on the "restriction_join" field of the parent restriction.

The allowed causes are either objects with an observed reading (such as a garage door opening or a geofence being triggered) or they are a time as defined by an iCal recurrence string.

EXAMPLES:

Note: each example could be in the causes or restrictions array on the robot object, causes are conditions that can trigger a robot and restrictions are conditions that can prevent a robot from being triggered.

            ]

## Effect Model

An effect is what happens if any of the causes occur outside of the optional restriction.

The effect has the following attributes:

|API field|Attributs|Description|
|----|----|----|
|scene|(refers to scene that would be activated)|If the effect affects devices, a scene will be created|
|recipient_actor_id |(String)|Refers to a user that would get a notification of some type. Scenes and recipient actors are currently mutually exclusive|
|recipient_actor_type|(String)|Refers to the type of actor, currently just "user". Scenes and recipient actors are currently mutually exclusive|
|notification_type|(String)|notification type to send "email" or "push"|
|note|(custom text object)|used in refrigerator notes|

An effect can have a scene OR a recipient_actor_id and notification_type, but should not have both.

If an effect has a note, it should also have a notification_type and recipient_actor.

**SCENE IN EFFECT**

The scene object is saved within the system and has a scene_id, but will come down as a full object for ease of use

**USER and NOTIFICATION_TYPE**

recipient_actor_id is the user_id of the user who will be receiving the notification

recipient_actor_type should be "user"

Allowed values for notification_type are "email" and "push"

## Custom Text Model
The custom text resource allows users to associate arbitrary text with another resource.

Currently a custom text is only able to be associated with an effect.

The custom text has the following attributes:

|API field|Attributes|Description|
|----|----|----|
|custom_text_id|(string, assigned, immutable)|API id|
|body|(string, writable, mutable)|String used as the message of the custom text|
|subject_id|(string, assigned, immutable)|Assigned, referencing effect that has the custom text|
|subject_type|(string, assigned, immutable)|Assigned, referencing effect that has the custom text|
