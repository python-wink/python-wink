# Reasons disabled:
# missing-docstring - Document as you like.  Good, descriptive method names and variables are preferred over docstrings.
# global-statement - used for the on-demand requirement installation
# invalid-name - this warning flags short names but I'm fine with short names when used correctly
# fixme - TODOs are allowed prior to v1.0
# locally-disabled - Because that's the whole point!
